      <h3>Teams and Points System</h3>
      <p>
        In Formula 1 there are 10 different teams competing for the constructors championship. Each team has 2 drivers that race for them. While these drivers are competing for the team, they are also competing individually for the drivers championship title at the same time. At the end of each race drivers get points based on what position they finished as well as an extra point for whichever driver had the fastest lap of the race. 
        The bottom 10 drivers don't get any points. 1st place gets 25 points, second gets 18, third gets 15, and so on all the way down to the driver in 10th getting 1 point. The points from  both drivers of a team are added to the teams score and at the end of the season, the F1 team with the most points gets crowned the constructors champion. 
        The 10 teams that are competing in F1 are: Red Bull Racing, Ferrari, Mclaren, Mercedes, Aston Martin, RB, Haas, Alpine, Williams, and Kick Sauber. Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez race for Red Bull. Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz race for Ferrari. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri race for Mclaren. Lewis Hamilton and George Russell race for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll race for Aston Martin. Yuki Tsunoda and Daniel Ricciardo for RB. Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen for Haas. Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon for Alpine. Alex Albon and Logan Sargeant for Williams. Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guany for Kick Sauber.

      <h3>Common Terms and Basics of F1</h3>
      <p>
        While watching an F1 there are many terms and phrases being said that someone who is brand new to watching racing might not understand. Something that is talked about alot is DRS. DRS is the drag reduction system that is on the formula 1 cars. This system does exactly what it sounds like, it reduces the drag on the car by lifting the spoiler up so that there is less downforce which allows the car to go slightly faster. This system is only allowed to activate in certain sections of the track that are called drs zones.
        While in these zones if a driver is less than a second away from the car in front of them, they are allowed to activate their drs in order to assist them in passing. Another thing that is commonly talked about is the different types of tires and the tire degradation throughout the race. While racing, the tires of an F1 car are put under a lot of stress and start to wear out after some time. The exact number of laps that tires wear out varies from track to track and on other factors such as weather. The longer that an F1 car is using one set of tires, the less grip it has and the car will become slower and harder to control. 
        There are 5 different types of tires in F1, softs, mediums, hards, intermediates, and wets. Softs, mediums, and hards are considered dry tires. These are used when the track isn't wet. The difference between these tires is that softs provide the most grip and therefore make it the fastest tire to be used, but they wear out quickly meaning that the team will most likely have to make a pit stop sooner than if they were using other tires. Hard tires are the slowest of the three dry tires but they wear out the slowest. Medium tires are a halfway point between the two. If it isn't raining during the race, each team is required to use at least 2 different types of tires at some point during the race. If it is raining though, teams are not required to use two different types of tires and they will switch to the rain tires. 
        The rain tires are the intermediate and the wet. The intermediate tires are better if the track is only slightly wet but, if the track is very wet then the wets will be better suited at giving the car traction to go faster in those conditions.

                In Formula 1 there are 10 different teams competing for the constructors championship. Each team has 2 
                drivers that race for them. While these drivers are competing for the team, they are also competing 
                individually for the drivers championship title at the same time. At the end of each race drivers get 
                points based on what position they finished as well as an extra point for whichever driver had the 
                fastest lap of the race. The bottom 10 drivers don't get any points. 1st place gets 25 points, second 
                gets 18, third gets 15, and so on all the way down to the driver in 10th getting 1 point. The points 
                from both drivers of a team are added to the teams score and at the end of the season, the F1 team with 
                the most points gets crowned the constructors champion.
